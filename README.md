# ASTU CourseHub

## Project Description

Course Hub is a mobile application designed specifically for ASTU students, offering comprehensive course information and a range of valuable features. The app serves as a centralized hub that streamlines course selection, academic planning, and access to essential university resources. Course Hub provides the following key features:

1. **User Registration**: Users can create an account within the app by providing their relevant information such as name, email address, and student ID. The registration process may also include password creation and validation.

2. **User Login**: Once registered, users can log in to the ASTU Course Hub using their credentials (email address and password). The app will authenticate the user's credentials before granting access to personalized features and information.

3. **User Profile**: After logging in, users can access and edit their profile information. They may have the option to update their contact details, profile picture, or other relevant information.

4. **Course Discussion Forum**: Each course listed in the ASTU Course Hub would have a dedicated discussion forum where students can post questions, share insights, and participate in discussions.

5. **Question Posting**: Students can post questions related to a specific course within the discussion forum. This can include inquiries about course content, assignments, projects, or any other related topics.

6. **Commenting and Replies**: Students can comment on existing questions or replies, providing answers, sharing their perspectives, or engaging in further discussion. This fosters a collaborative learning environment where students can assist and learn from one another.

7. **Upvoting and Downvoting**: To prioritize the most relevant and helpful contributions, users can upvote or downvote questions and comments. This helps highlight valuable insights and reduce clutter in the discussion forum.

8. **Notifications**: Users can opt to receive notifications when there are new comments or replies on questions they have posted or engaged with. This ensures that students stay updated and can actively participate in ongoing discussions.

9. **Course Instructor Participation**: Course instructors or teaching assistants can also access the discussion forum to provide clarifications, additional information, or guidance. Their participation can greatly enhance the learning experience for students.

10. **Moderation and Report System**: To maintain a respectful and productive environment, the app can incorporate moderation features and a report system. Users can report inappropriate or irrelevant content, and moderators can review and take appropriate actions.

11. **Course Information**: The app provides detailed descriptions of courses offered by each department. Students can easily browse through the available courses, view prerequisites, and gain a better understanding of the course content.

12. **Grade Calculator**: The ASTU Course Hub includes a grade calculator feature that allows students to calculate their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and semester grade point average (GPA). By inputting their course grades and credit hours, students can track their academic progress and make informed decisions.

13. **Contact Details**: The application provides important contact details for faculty members, department heads, and administrative staff. Students can easily find and communicate with the relevant personnel for academic inquiries or administrative support.

14. **Block Numbers**: The app offers a directory of block numbers on the ASTU campus. Students can quickly locate classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and other facilities using the interactive map within the application.

## Programming Language

For the development of the ASTU Course Hub, we have chosen Flutter as the programming language. Flutter is a powerful UI toolkit developed by Google that allows for cross-platform development. By utilizing Flutter, we can create a single codebase that is compatible with both Android and iOS platforms, reducing development time and effort.

Flutter provides a fast development process with its hot reload functionality, enabling developers to see instant changes in the app during the coding process. Additionally, Flutter offers a rich UI framework, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Furthermore, Flutter ensures native performance by compiling the code into native machine code, resulting in better speed and responsiveness. The extensive widget library and reactive programming model of Flutter make it an ideal choice for building an interactive and feature-rich mobile application like the ASTU Course Hub.

Lastly, Flutter has a strong community support system, which means ample resources, documentation, and community forums are available for developers to seek assistance and resolve any challenges they may encounter during the development process.
